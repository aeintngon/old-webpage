    <p class="content">A closer look at the types of crimes that are contributing to the increase in number of crime incidents over the past 7 year revealed theft to be the main culprit. While there's a decline in the number of burglary, there are also slight increases in other crime types such as robbery and sex abuses. &#40;The graph also shows decreases in incidences of motor vehicle theft but auto theft has been increasing since 2009&#41; In the 1900's, Washington DC was known as the <a class="link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/13/us/13deecee.html?_r=1&n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FPeople%2FW%2FWilliams%2C%20Anthony%20A.">&quot;murder capital&quot;</a> with 472 homicide cases. In 2008, the number of homicide cases drop by more than half at 178 cases reported. Incidents of homicides were the least at 2012 at 89 cases and stayed pretty low until 2015 when it reached 160 cases which caused quite a stir.

    <p class="content">There's a saying that darkness hides the worst of human&#39;s behavior. So, normally we could expect the number of crimes to peak during the time of darkness. However, in Washington DC, most of the crimes are commited in the day time&#33; In 2016, they peaked at 1pm and 9pm and in 2014, they peaked at 1pm and 3pm. A closer look at the spread of 2016 crimes also revealed that theft was dominating the day time crime incidents, along with burlary, while crimes relating to robbery and weapon seemed to be higher during the hours of darkness.</p>
