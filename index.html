	<p class="content">Hello world! Welcome to Aeint's Portfolio. I'm a current Master's student. I started this page to display the projects I have worked on during the summer and months to come. I will be using open source data, data scraped off the web for my analysis. I will also try to work in different techniques, tools and languages for data science.</p>
	<p class="content">I will be experimenting using different data visualization tools, working with text data for sentiment analysis and with image processing and recognition. I would really appreciate any feedback on my work. And so if you have any feedback, question or idea, please email me at <a class="link" href="mailto:an692@georgetown.edu" target="_blank"> an692@georgetown.edu</a>.</p>
