	<h2>ABOUT</h2>
	<hr id='top-line'>
    	<p class="content">My name is Aeint Thet Ngon. I'm a current Master's candidate at Georgetown University's Data Analytics Program with concentration in Data Science. During my undergraduate studies, while I was pursing my BA in Mathematics and Economics, I had the opprotunity to work on a pilot project to use hospital data from New York and California to learn more about diseases that are easily misdiagnosed. This opportunity made me realize how much I enjoyed playing with data. <br>
	I would really enjoy more opporunities for me to work on health or public good related projects. I also like to use data visualization to find "hidden facts". <br></p>
	If you are interested in using data science to change the world for better, please email me at <a href="mailto:an692@georgetown.edu" target="_blank"> an692@georgetown.edu</a>.<br></p>
	For my background and further information, please connect with me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/aeintngon" target="_blank">my Linkedin</a>.<br></p>
