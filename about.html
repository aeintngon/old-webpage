	<h2>ABOUT</h2>
	<hr id='top-line'>
    	<p>Originally from Myanmar, a beautiful southeast Asian country, I came to the states about 5 years ago for the first time to a little midwestern town, Mount Vernon, Iowa for my undergraduate studies at Cornell College. 
    	After finishing my B.A. in Mathematics and Economics &amp; Business, I moved to DC to work on my Master's in Data Science at Georgetown University.
